				"Queer love was only able to exist privately for a long time, expressed in society through coded art form. I wrote this<br> song as a story of unrequited love in my own life, doing my<br> best to acknowledge and pay homage to that part of history"

			<p>
				I hate it when dudes try to chase me<br>
				But I love it when you try to save me<br>
				Cause I'm just a lady<br>
				I love it when we play 1950<br>
				It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me<br>
				I'm surprised when you kiss me
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Pre-Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
				And tell me why it's wrong
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
				For you, I'll wait<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Verse 2</p>
			<p>
				Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?<br>
				That you didn't wanna live in a city<br>
				Where the people are shitty?<br>
				I like it when we play 1950<br>
				So bold, make them know that you're with me<br>
				Stone cold, will you miss me?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Pre-Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
				And tell me why it's wrong
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
				For you, I'll wait<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Bridge</p>
			<p>
				I hope that you're happy with me in your life<br>
				I hope that you won't slip away in the night<br>
				I hope that you're happy with me in your life<br>
				I hope that you won't slip away<br>
				I hate it when dudes try to chase me<br>
				I love it when you try to save me<br>
				'Cause I'm just a lady
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Pre-Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
				And tell me why it's wrong
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="verse">Chorus</p>
			<p>
				So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
				(For your love, for your love, for your love)<br>
				For you, I'll wait<br>
				I will keep on waiting for your
