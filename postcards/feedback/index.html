	<h1>Feedback for: Emily Bielski</h1>
	<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
		<div class="question">Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Your design is very clear and simple, could maybe use some more complexity.</div>

		<div class="question">Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Your typeface choice could possibly relate to Game of Thrones more closely, or have more tone than the serif you have now.</div>

		<div class="question">Do the imagery and design choices support the text?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes! Each quote provides a good portrait of the character, and the text placement works well with each image.</div>

		<div class="question">Is the aesthetic consistent?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes, all type is same size + typeface + similar placement/alignment.</div>

		<div class="question">Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vise-versa?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Your aesthetic could be further used to strengthen your concept, ie stylistic changes like typeface.</div>

		<div class="question">Is it legible?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes! Great resolution too.</div>

		<div class="question">Are type size/color/face/treatment chocies helping or hurting?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Color is really helping, great contrast + easy to read. The type size on the mobile images look a bit small.</div>

	<h2>Structure</h2>
		<div class="question">What are the design's visual priorities?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Clarity, ample space for picture, image/figure first then text, clear visual hierarchy with quote coming first then character quoted in italics.</div>

		<div class="question">Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Complement, everything fits together well and different alignments of text feel very natural.</div>

		<div class="question">What elements do you consider foreground? Background?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Image is background but figure in image is foreground, text is mid/foreground.</div>

		<div class="question">How will the design accomodate variability in browser width?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Cropping of images are very successful and don't feel forced. One thing to note (for mobile mockups) is that with the images cropped + cutting off some of the figure, it gives more emphasis to the space that the characters are activating and therefore the text. The small size of the text confuses this hierarchy a little. </div>

		<div class="question">Is transparency, if used, used appropriately</div>
		<div class="feedback">n/a. I think you could use transparency successfully if you want, but with the blurred background I don't think it's necessary for clarity.</div>

	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
		<div class="question">What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided?</div>
		<div class="feedback">For image, it would be nice to see an incremental cropping of the images (and maybe a small zoom in?). For text, since some of the text switches sides (ex: arya switches from left of figure to right), that could be a sudden switch. Sizing of text could also be an incremental change.</div>

		<div class="question">At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does cntrast affect legibility?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Legibility may be affected if the space between text and figure isn't maintained. Right now you have a very comfortable space between figure and image, maybe maintain this through scale shift?</div>

		<div class="question">WAre images presented with sufficient resolution, and without unintentional distortion or compression artifacts?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes!</div>

		<div class="question">Have image edges all been considereed and managed?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes! Edge relationships look good, and lines in image correspond with alignment of text.</div>

		<div class="question">Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes!</div>

		<div class="question">Can you build it?</div>
		<div class="feedback">Yes! Good job</div>
