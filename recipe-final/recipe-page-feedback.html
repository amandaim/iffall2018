1. actual fractions for ingredients
2. break steps into smaller text chunks
3. bold/italicize ingredients in steps (make different from body text)

1. tall typeface --> leading is a little tight
2. header: too much contrast from bold to thin, incorporate more bold text in body
3. margins too small on intro text

Notes to self:
1. change numbers to actual fractions
2. make interactive ingredients in instructions? or typographically differentiate
3. incorporate more type weights into body (so bold header doesn't feel so out of place)
4. check margins and spacing in sections
