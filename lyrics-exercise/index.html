	<h2>King Princess</h2>
	<p class="verse1">[Verse 1]</p>
	<p>I hate it when dudes try to chase me<br>
	But I love it when you try to save me<br>
	'Cause I'm just a lady<br>
	I love it when we play 1950<br>
	It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me<br>
	I'm surprised when you kiss me</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
	<p>So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
	And tell me why it's wrong</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Chorus]</p>
	<p>So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
	For you, I'll wait<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Verse 2]</p>
	<p>Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?<br>
	That you didn't wanna live in a city<br>
	Where the people are shitty?<br>
	I like it when we play 1950<br>
	So bold, make them know that you're with me<br>
	Stone cold, will you miss me?</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
	<p>So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
	And tell me why it's wrong</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Chorus]</p>
	<p>So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
	For you, I'll wait<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Bridge]</p>
	<p>I hope that you're happy with me in your life<br>
	I hope that you won't slip away in the night<br>
	I hope that you're happy with me in your life<br>
	I hope that you won't slip away<br>
	I hate it when dudes try to chase me<br>
	I love it when you try to save me<br>
	'Cause I'm just a lady</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
	<p>So tell me why my gods look like you<br>
	And tell me why it's wrong</p>

	<p class="secondary">[Chorus]</p>
	<p>So I'll wait for you, I'll pray<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your love<br>
	(For your love, for your love, for your love)<br>
	For you, I'll wait<br>
	I will keep on waiting for your</p>
